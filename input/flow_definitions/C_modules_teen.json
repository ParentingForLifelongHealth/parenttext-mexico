        "tips.message.1.text": "1️⃣ **BE CALM**\n\n✅ Shouting or hitting our teens only makes things worse. It also teaches them that it is okay to treat others like this when they are upset.\n\n✅ Take some deep breaths, take a pause, or walk away if you need to.\n\n✅ Then, respond in a calm, clear way.",
        "tips.message.2.text": "2️⃣ **BE FAIR**\n✅ Give your teen the option to behave before giving a consequence. For example, say, “Either you do your homework now, or you cannot watch your favourite T.V. show tonight.”\n✅ Talk about consequences for breaking household rules when you set them so Your Teen knows them already.\n\n👂 Listen to their view.\n\n\n✅ Notice if your teen is experiencing a consequence of their action already. If so, you might not need to give them one other consequence.",
        "tips.message.3.text": "3️⃣ **BE CONSISTENT**\n\n➡️ It is important to follow through with consequences for the rules you have set every time they do not follow them.\n\n⭐ This helps your teen to know what to expect, and makes it more likely that they will follow the rule.\n\n🎈 Talk about the consequences for breaking household rules when you set them so that Your Teen knows them and stick to them.",
        "tips.message.4.text": "4️⃣ **BE POSITIVE**\n\n✅ Praise your teen for actions you want to see more of so that they know what they are doing right, too!\n\n✅ See if you can avoid giving consequences at all, by redirecting them to something else before they behave badly.\n\n✅ Consequences help our teens learn how their actions affect others - and to think before they act.\n\n✅Using consequences can be hard at first, but will be easier with practice!",
